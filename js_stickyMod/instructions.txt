Installing Sticky Mod is extremely simple since it does not use any plug-ins.
This also means you can install at most studios and schools, as well as at home.
To install, simply unzip the download and copy the "js_stickyMod" directory into
"maya/scripts". The end result should be "maya/scripts/js_stickyMod". The "maya"
directory is usually found on your home drive or in "Documents" on Windows. On
Mac OS it is usually found in  Library/preferences/autodesk/maya/scripts".

In a fresh Maya session, copy/paste the following code into a Python tab of the
script editor and either run it or middle-mouse drag it to a shelf to make a button:

import js_stickyMod.ui
try:
    from importlib import reload
except:
    pass
reload (js_stickyMod.ui)
js_stickyMod.ui.ui ()
